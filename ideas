Boost regulator for motors
	Diodes Inc PAM2423

Switchable between 9V and 4.5V.
Could just do this in SW by adjusting the PWM?
Or globally by changing power supply?

Use DRV8838 chips or perhaps switch to TB6612FN. The latter would
require logic to convert from dir+pwm to pwm+pwm, or more pwm outputs,
the former only goes to 10.5V

Use 2Ah lipo cell or 900mAh? The sparkfun 2Ah is 7cm x 5cm x 7mm, our
usual 900mAh one is 6x3x.5
